A collection of workstation setup scripts to work with my dotfiles

> Note: This project will soon be deprecated!

## What is it?

*forge-legacy* is the arrangement of my workstation setup scripts that used to reside as a part of [my dotfiles](https://github.com/myTerminal/dotfiles) and is soon to be replaced with [forge](https://github.com/myTerminal/forge). The purpose of existence for this project is to prepare for the switch. Having said that, is may still continue to work, except that my setup itself may evolve, which includes the software packages or the other configuration that I depend on in my workflow.

## Difference from [forge](https://github.com/myTerminal/forge)

[forge](https://github.com/myTerminal/forge) has been designed to be a reusable tool to quickly configure a workstation. *forge-legacy* on the other hand is comprised of Bash setup scripts that depend on [twiner](https://github.com/myTerminal/twiner), along with my personal choice of packages and configuration in the same bundle, making it less meaningful for other users.
