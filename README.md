A collection of workstation setup scripts to work with my dotfiles

> **Note:** This project has been deprecated in favor of [forge](https://github.com/myTerminal/forge).

## What is it?

*forge-legacy* is the arrangement of my workstation setup scripts that used to reside as a part of [my dotfiles](https://github.com/myTerminal/dotfiles), now replaced with [forge](https://github.com/myTerminal/forge). Though the project may still continue to work, please expect issues.

## Difference from [forge](https://github.com/myTerminal/forge)

[forge](https://github.com/myTerminal/forge) has been designed to be a reusable tool to quickly configure a workstation with just a simple configuration file written in a Lisp-like format. *forge-legacy* on the other hand comprised of Bash setup scripts that depend on [twiner](https://github.com/myTerminal/twiner), along with my personal choice of packages and configuration in the same bundle, making it less meaningful for others.
